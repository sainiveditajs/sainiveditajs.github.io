I'm a clinician-turned Masters student at Cornell University, studying Health Administration. Passionate about bringing impactful digital health solutions to providers, streamlining workflows and improving patient outcomes.

I worked in dentistry and surgical oncology in India, and co-founded a healthtech startup that helped over 100 seniors in Chennai gain control over their medical and pharmaceutical data. This helped me recognize the need for change, and how technology can optimize care delivery.

When I am not working, I enjoy powerlifting (competing in May 2024 next!), singing and writing on Medium, and X.
